Description: We will see the progress of the program with the help of the design template: reactor.

Client 1 will create a new graph and as a response the server will ask him to insert the edges.
At this point, at the same time, client 2 will insert edges into the graph.
After client 2 finishes inserting the new edges, we will return to client 1 and he will complete his work (inserting the edges into the graph he built).
We will run Kosaraju and it will appear that client 2 was indeed able to perform an operation at the same time as client number 1.
That is, client 1 does not stop the other clients by not yet typing the edges of the new graph.
