Client 1 will create a new graph and as a response the server will ask him to insert the edges.
At this point, at the same time, client 2 will try to insert edges into the graph.
We will see that the mutex will prevent him from performing the operation and only after client 1 finishes his operation then the new edges of client 2 will enter.


<> Server:

Please type:

./server


<> Client 1:

Please type line ny line:

./client

Newgraph 8,5


## Stop with customer 1 and move on to customer 2 ##

<> Client 2:

Please type line ny line:

./client

Newedge 0,1
Newedge 1,2
Newedge 2,3
Newedge 3,0

## Stop with customer 2 and move on to customer 1 ##

<> Client 1:

Please type line ny line:

### Now that client 1 is done, client 2 will receive a response for its attempts to insert new edges into the graph  ####
